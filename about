# About Apex Invent

Apex Invent was founded in the early months of 2023, we set out with the goal to develop a proudly South African machine, we have had some ups and downs during this time an have restructured ourselves, all of the developments made by Apex Invent will be fully open source giving our community something to be proud of!

The core development and open source part of Apex Invent is a one man show but we are hoping to turn it into a community!

Welcome to Apex Invent

### Motion Systems

All Apex Invent machines with CoreXY systems apart from the CNC machines as it has proven to be the most efficient way to acchieve higher accelerations and speed with the given moving mass. Apex Invent machines are designed with budget and configuration in mind, allowing users to build a basic machine using Linear rods and lower end components while allowing them to upgrade to the higher end configurations down the line.

### Frames
We use standard locally available extrusions for all of our machines, these include PG20, PG30, PG40 and PG60 series aluminium extrusions.

### Klipper

All Apex Invent Machines apart from the CNCs use [Klipper](https://www.klipper3d.org/Overview.html) firmware. Klipper uses a more powerful computer such as a Raspberry Pi for all the computation-heavy tasks and sends a list of preprocessed orders to the controller board. This gives a considerable amount of flexibility as a variety of control boards (or combination of boards) can be easily configured. As well, more complex features such as input shaping (to reduce ringing) can be added no matter what control board is used. Finally, configuring firmware is fast and easy. Change to your desired parameter in an easy to read printer configuration file, save, and restart Klipper--a few seconds later the printer is ready to go!

### Serial Numbers

To get your own serial number, all you have to do after completing a Apex Invent build is to post a video of your printer printing on the Apex Invent [Discord](https://discord.gg/vhEEsyMe3b). Be sure to have your machine fully built and assembled - All electronics should be closed and wires should be neat, your machine should be safe!
