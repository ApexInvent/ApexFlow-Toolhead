# A guide to printing Apex Invent parts

In this guide, we will guide you through the recommended materials & print settings for all Apex Invent developed parts.

## Materials
When deciding what materials to use when printing Apex Invent parts, some criteria need to be considered.
Firstly your material of choice will be very dependent on what product it is you are building.

For 3D Printers & toolheads, it's common to see the temperatures inside the machine reach upward of 50 ºC.
The material should have a “glass transition temperature” (the temperature at which the plastic starts deforming) that is at least 80 ºC.

### PLA
PLA has a glass transition temperature of around 55–60 ºC. It is very stiff and has low ductility (the ability of a material to have its shape changed without losing strength or breaking). 
It is not recommended for Apex Invent parts. This is due to both the low-temperature tolerance and the low ductility that can occasionally cause unexpected cracking. 
The high-temperature variant HTPLA is viable for temperature tolerance but is expensive and still has issues with ductility and risk of cracking. 
PLA is entirely acceptable for beauty pieces, panel clips, and electronic mounts as they do not see the same high temperatures or forces.
